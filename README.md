GDS Short Course - Deep Learning for Image Processing Applications: Learning physics from imaging data: mesoscopic and stochastic systems

Here you will find some material related to a tutorial run at APS March Meeting 2020, in Denver CO on March 1, 2020. 

Specifically the work here relating to the section on Learning Physics from Imaging data within teh Deep Learning for Image Processing Applications short course.

A colab notebook is available for the interactive part of this tutorial <a href = "https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gTMqOHkGoWkGeK3D-CoNBi8H1FAFVHuo">here</a>.
